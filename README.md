Hello! This is a Blackjack game made with Python. The rules are simple: The computer's gonna deal you a few cards, and you gotta draw as many as you wish to get as close to 21 (the 'Blackjack Sum') as possible.
Be careful! If your cards sum goes higher than '21', you lose immediately! 
Enjoy the game :)
